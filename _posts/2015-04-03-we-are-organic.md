#We are Organic

##What's organic?

Put simply, organic food is produced from non-genetically modified organisms (GMOs) without the use of chemical fertilizers or pesticides.

##But did you know that organic is much more?

Let's think of organic in terms of a philosophy or a way of life rather.  Its primary goal is to optimize the health and productivity of soil life, plants, animals, and people.

At every stage of production, organic is designed to:

- respect the environment though preserving biodiversity and using soil, water, and air responsibly.
- protect the long-term health of soil, encouraging soil biological activity and minimizing soil degradation and erosion
- provide livestock with humane living conditions for their health and well-being
- recycle materials and resources whenever possible and reduce the use of non-renewable resources.


<br />
Organic production does not allow the use of:

- GMOs
- synthetic pesticides or synthetic fertilizers
- sewage sludge
- ionizing radiation, which some manufactures use to sterilize food
- industrial solvents or chemical food additives to make food **look** pretty and fresh
- antibiotics or growth hormones for animals that produce meat, poultry, eggs, and dairy products


So why choose organic?  That's next week on Organic :-)
